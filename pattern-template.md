# Summary

> **DISCLAIMER**: This notebook is used for demonstrative and illustrative purposes only and does not constitute an offering that has gone through regulatory review. It is not intended to serve as a medical application. There is no representation as to the accuracy of the output of this application and it is presented without warranty.

In this Code Pattern, we will use anonymous patient data to predict the best drug to treat heart disease. This notebook introduces commands for getting data, model persistance to Watson Machine Learning repository, model deployment, and scoring.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* Prepare data, create an Apache Spark machine learning pipeline, and train a model.
* Publish a sample model in the Watson Machine Learning (WML) repository.
* Deploy a model for online scoring.
* Score the model using sample scoring records and the scoring endpoint.

# Technologies

* [Analytics](https://developer.ibm.com/watson/): Analytics delivers the value of data for the enterprise.
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/ibm-watson): Artificial intelligence can be applied to disparate solution spaces to deliver disruptive technologies
* [Data Science](https://medium.com/ibm-watson): Systems and scientific methods to analyze structured and unstructured data in order to extract knowledge and insights.

# Description

# Flow

> Provide a draft architecture diagram followed by the flow steps; the architecture diagram needs to show a complete set of people, components, and technologies covered by your pattern; add numbers to the diagram that correspond with the written flow steps. The flow steps provide the  details of what happens at each stage, and the tasks performed by each component or technology; these are not steps to reproduce the code, but a description of the architecture of the code.

> Upload a draft architecture diagram to this issue. Remember to include numbers in the diagram to represent the flow steps that you provide below the diagram. A graphic designer will use your draft to create the production-ready image.

1. Flow step 1
2. Flow step 2
3. Flow step 3

# Instructions

> Find the detailed steps for this pattern in the [readme file](https://github.com/IBM/prediction-using-watson-machine-learning/blob/master/README.md). The steps will show you how to:

# Announcement
> Every pattern must have an announcement post that introduces it. The announcement should explain why the pattern is important or useful. The announcement is an invitation to try the pattern; you can expand on why you created the pattern, discuss any challenges that you overcame, or expand on the technologies that you're using.

> *Announcements should be at least 2-3 paragraphs*
